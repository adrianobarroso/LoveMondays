# LoveMondays Coding Test - TicTacToe - Adriano W Barroso

I follow all the instructions on the test briefing and added some other features.

Have broke down `Game` into 2 different classes trying to mimic MVC design
to make it easy to accomplish the test. Let only the core of the class `Game` into it.

## Testing the code

To run the game, now you just need to run:

```
ruby run_game.rb
```

And interact with the game interface.
